   dataframe, represents an individual’s answer to a particular question. The second column of the dataframe represents
   <i>
    age
   </i>
   , and the first row contains Selma’s responses. Selma’s response has the cell value of 18 for
   <i>
    age
   </i>
   . However, it is noteworthy that Juan’s
   <i>
    age
   </i>
   response, which should be in the second row, is missing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Why would these missing data matter? Missing information might frustrate us in our analysis. Mirabel would not be able to identify Juan’s responses about voting as belonging to groups of older versus younger respondents, which may have implications for strategic ways to get the vote out differently for each age group. Remember that a row in a dataframe represents each person’s response across many columns (i.e., many variables).
  </p>
  <p>
   What do we do with missing data? The best solution is to rerun the study with tighter response controls to avoid missing values (e.g., adding a dropdown menu of pet options instead of an open- ended response). However, this is not always possible, especially if the data come from a third party, as with Mirabel’s dataset. Thus, we discuss a few other ways of addressing missing values in our data:

   Dataset: vote
  </p>
  <p>
   GPA data is a way to understand people’s educational performance and its potential relationship with voting behavior. A significant number of missing values can impact our analysis, potentially skewing results and obscuring key insights. By identifying the extent of missing
   <span>
    GPA
   </span>
   records, we aim to evaluate the dataset’s reliability, inform subsequent data cleaning or imputation methods, and uncover any underlying patterns associated with these data gaps. This step is essential in ensuring that our analysis is both accurate and meaningful.
  </p>
  <p>
   Answer the following questions (Round float (i.e., non-integer) values to two decimal places):
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li data-list-text="1.">
    <p>
     How many missing values are there in the GPA column?
    </p>
   </li>

   <li data-list-text="4.">
    <p>
     How would you describe this using the STAR framework?
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   <b>
    Method 2:
   </b>
   This time we impute missing values for age rather than remove them, again following up with a mean calculation to compare with that of Method 1. To impute the missing ages, let’s use the mean age of the complete (or “known”) observations, which, as calculated in Method 1, is 2185
   <span>
    .
   </span>
   72 years. This assumes that the age of the objects found at this archaeological site can generally be described well by their average value. Table 2.3 is our completed dataset:

  </p>
  <p>
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   After imputation, the sum of the ages is
  </p>
  <p>
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   2000+2185
   <span>
    .
   </span>
   72+3000+1500+2185
   <span>
    .
   </span>
   72+2500+2185
   <span>
    .
   </span>
   72+2000+2185
   <span>
    .
   </span>
   72+1900+2185
   <span>
    .
   </span>
   72+2400  =  26,228.57
  </p>
  <p>
   And we have 12 objects, so the mean age after imputation is still 2185
   <span>
    .
   </span>
   72 years.
  </p>
  <p>
   So, we see that imputing missing values with the mean age will leave the mean age unchanged.
  </p>
  <p>
   We could also use the median instead of the mean to impute missing values.

   In our ongoing analysis of the voter survey dataset, we now tackle the issue of missing GPA values by employing the mean imputation method. Our objective is to create a new column in the dataset, which will replicate the original GPA data but with a key modification: missing values will be filled in with the mean GPA of the available data.

   Imputation from External Data
  </p>
  <p>
   We have so far described
   <i>
    imputation from internal data
   </i>
   based on values within the same dataset. However,
   <i>
    imputation from external data
   </i>
   based on values from a different dataset is also possible. For example, in the case of Mirabel’s dataset, she could access the college’s roster that includes the year of birth for each student. Alternatively, if the college cannot provide data about birth dates, she could use public data about the average age of students in Juan’s class. Even better, if she already has information about Juan from another dataset, and she is sure it is the same Juan, she should replace Juan’s missing age value with the known age. However, she would not refer to this as an imputation because the values would be known, not estimated. When imputing data from external datasets, we should trust that the other sources of data are reputable and relevant to our original dataset.
  </p>
  <p>
   The downside to imputation, whether from internal or external data, is that it makes assumptions and modifies the raw values, thereby influencing the analysis. These decisions should always be documented and reported.

   Changing the Scale of a Quantitative Variable
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   Think about the last time you saw graphs or data visualizations that contained any sort of numbers. How many digits were there in each of the values displayed on the graph? We often have to make this choice as the person working with the data. A dataset may contain an income variable whose values are as low as $20
   <span>
    ,
   </span>
   000 and as high as $800
   <span>
    ,
   </span>
   000. Reading such large numbers on a data visualization can be challenging, so we might consider scaling these numbers down in a way that reduces the number of digits but still allows us to convey similar information. For example, we could create a new variable that represents income in thousands of US dollars, which is computed by dividing the original income variable by 1
   <span>
    ,
   </span>
   000.

   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   In Table 2.5, the Pet_Preference categorical variable has been transformed into three new binary variables: Prefers_Dogs, Prefers_Cats, and Prefers_None. This quantitative transformation allows for numerical analysis and modeling that could not be accomplished with the original categorical data. For example, we can sum the values of Prefers_Dogs using the following equation:
  </p>
  <p>
   1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2
  </p>
  <p>
   Since there are five records, we know that
   <span>
    ⅖
   </span>
   = 0
   <span>
    .
   </span>
   4 = 40% of respondents prefer dogs. Creating quan- titative variables from categorical variables is even more important in future chapters on machine learning.

     The process of creating a quantitative variable from a categorical variable is often called
     <i>
      encoding
     </i>
     because we are creating numeric codes associated with each category, or value, of the categorical variable. Boolean encoding is a special case of variable encoding where we assign a 1 or 0 during encoding. In transforming Pet_Preference to Prefers_Dogs, we were implementing
     <i>
      Boolean encoding
     </i>
     with the value of “Dog” as 1 and any other value as 0. In general, we can use whatever numeric values we want, but we must be extremely careful when doing so. The numeric values we use should reflect the categories as best as we can. In particular, the differences between the categories should align with the differences in the numeric values as much as possible. For example, suppose we have data on people’s feelings about a particular movie with the following possible responses:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li data-list-text="■">
      <p>
       Dislike
      </p>
     </li>
     <li data-list-text="■">
      <p>
       Neutral
      </p>
     </li>
     <li data-list-text="■">
      <p>
       Like
      </p>
     </li>

   DEFINITION
  </p>
  <p>
   Encoding
   <span>
    is the process of converting a categorical variable into a quantitative one by assigning numeric codes to the values of the categorical variable.

   Table 2.6 presents three possible encoding schemes for these categories, each differing in how they represent these values.
  </p>
  <p>
   is because the combining of categories, although it may end up being informative, is a reduction in the information contained in the variable. Note that Encoding Scheme 3 in Table 2.6 was actually an example of
   <i>
    condensing the categories
   </i>
   .

   Splitting a Variable into Multiple Variables
  </p>
  <p>
   Data can come in all shapes and sizes, and this includes variables. It’s not uncommon for free- response questions to have answers in many different formats. Consider entering information for your birthdate. If you were given an unformatted prompt for your birthdate, you might enter it as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
   July 7, 2007
  </p>
  <p>
   And this might be exactly how your value for the birthdate variable appears in the dataset. However, the visualization and analysis of these data may involve the months and years in which people were born. This would require the extraction of the month and year from values of birthdate like the one above, ignoring the day. All software tools will have methods for extracting information like this.
  </p>
  <p>
   In general, the
   <i>
    splitting
   </i>
   of a categorical variable describes the process of extracting pieces of infor- mation from its values and storing them in at least one new categorical variable (e.g., month name) or quantitative variable (e.g., year). Figure 2.3 provides an example of such a splitting operation.

   Dataset: vote
  </p>
  <p>
   We revisit the voter survey dataset with a focus on identifying variations in voting patterns across different birth months. Later, we aim to determine if there is a discernible relationship between voters’ birth months and their voting behaviors. To facilitate this analysis, we will modify the dataset by isolating the birth month from the existing birthdate information. This involves generating a new column dedicated solely to the birth month. This modification is essential for conducting a detailed exploration into how voting preferences may vary according to the birth month of the respondents.

   Section 2.6: Reshaping a Data Set
  </p>
  <p>
   The last type of data transformation we consider here is
   <i>
    reshaping
   </i>
   a dataset. Recall that a
   <i>
    tidy
   </i>
   dataset is one in which each column represents a variable, each row represents an observation, and each cell has a value. Often a raw dataset presented as a table will not be in a tidy format because of the shape that it’s in.
  </p>
  <p>
   Figure 2.4 provides an example of a Gapminder dataset that is not tidy. In this example, we have a row for each country in the world and a column for each year between 1800 and 2020. Each cell contains the population value for a particular country and year combination. The three variables in this dataset are country, year, and population. However, the years only appear as column names and not as values in a column. A tidy version of this dataset would have three columns, one for each of these variables, and a row for each combination of country and year. Each combination of country and year (e.g., Afghanistan in 1800) can be considered as an observational unit.
